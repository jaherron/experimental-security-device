# Experimental Security Device
A weird security device made with a pi-top[4].

##  How does it work?
What you need is:
1. The script (esd_v1.0.py)
2. A pi-top[4]
3. The pi-top[4] Foundation Kit

Connection ports:
1. Red LED in port D5
2. Green LED in port D4
3. Button in port D2
4. Ultrasonic Sensor in port D6
5. Buzzer in port D3

##  Can I submit modified versions of the script?
Just post your versions in the community-mods folder.

##  Is there a demonstration?
I made a [YouTube short](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DT0UeTSa_VE) about it.
I also demonstrated it in my [full-length pi-top[4] review](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Isvwee-22lI). (it's a long video!)

##  Can I contact you with questions?
